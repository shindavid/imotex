Let $x$ be the measure of $\angle PAD$. Let $M$ be the point on segment $AD$ such that $AM = PM$. Because triangle $MAP$ is isosceles, we have $\angle MAP = \angle APM = x$, which then demands $\angle AMP = 180 - 2x$. The ratio condition implies that $\angle PBA = 2x$, and so quadrilateral $AMPB$ is cyclic. Furthermore, since $AMP$ and $\angle DMP$ are supplementary, we have $\angle DMP= 2x$. The ratio condition implies that $\angle DPA = 3x$, and thus that $\angle DPM = 2x$. Thus,
$\triangle DMP$ is isosceles, meaning that the internal bisector of $\angle ADP$ is in fact the perpendicular bisector of segment $MP$. The angle bisector of $\angle ADP$ and the perpendicular bisector of $AB$ thus both represent perpendicular bisectors of sides of cyclic quadrilateral $AMPB$, and so necessarily meet at the center of the circumscribing circle. Similarly, the angle bisector of $\angle PCB$ must go through the center of the circumscribing circle. The desired conclusion
follows.
